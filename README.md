MTA Ridership Recovery Analysis
This repository contains a Power BI project analyzing the recovery trends of ridership for various MTA services post-pandemic. The dashboard provides insights into ridership recovery percentages across different service types and time periods, offering a comprehensive overview of transit usage trends.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to explore how ridership across the following MTA services has recovered compared to pre-pandemic levels:

Subways
Buses
Metro-North
Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)
Access-A-Ride
Bridges and Tunnels
The analysis uses ridership data from March 2020 to October 2024 and compares it with pre-pandemic baselines. Both actual recovery percentages (calculated dynamically) and pre-calculated percentages are displayed.
